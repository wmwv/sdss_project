* Git

* SQL
 Lots of things out there.  The following is one: http://sqlzoo.net/
 - I have a book I like if anyone really wants to get serious
 - But really learning it in context of accessing real data sets is probably the best place to start:

SDSS Sky Server
 http://skyserver.sdss3.org/public/en/home.aspx

SDSS SQL Introductory Query
 http://skyserver.sdss3.org/public/en/tools/search/sql.aspx
 - You can retrieve information as HTML, XML, CSV, JSON, VOTable, or binary FITS table.  
 - We showed pages of HTML retrieval, but then downloaded a binary FITS table for our future use. 

SDSS SQL Example Queries Covering a number of use cases:
 http://skyserver.sdss3.org/public/en/help/docs/realquery.aspx

SDSS SQL Schema
 http://skyserver.sdss3.org/public/en/help/browser/browser.aspx

SDSS CasJobs
 http://skyserver.sdss3.org/CasJobs/
  - If you ever need to get really serious for queries that return more rows, take more time to run, or if you want some space to upload and download tables more at your leisure, you want SDSS CasJobs

* Regular Expressions (regex).  
 http://www.bohyunkim.net/blog/archives/2595
  -- A somewhat random choice, but a pretty helpful post.

* How to Efficiently and Powerfully Search-and-Replace in Emacs and vi:
 --  Emacs regular expressions and searching:
   http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_regex.html
   http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_find_replace.html
   http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Search.html#Search
   http://www.cs.utah.edu/dept/old/texinfo/emacs18/emacs_17.html

 -- vi: I switched to vi as a postdoc.  I assume you never will.
  vi: Intro including Regex
   http://cmd.inp.nsk.su/old/cmd2/manuals/unix/UNIX_Unleashed/ch03.htm
 A brief tutorial on vi for those who are interested in the dark path
   http://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/vim_tutorial.html
 The command 'vimtutor' will walk you through a helpful introduction.
  - 'vim' is the most commonly installed, but everyone still calls it vi
     (both in speech and at the command line).

 -- Nano:
   I think most people who would using regex are emacs or vi users.
   I don't use nano myself, and I couldn't quickly find a reference
   But if you do, there is certainly a regex reference to help.

* Laziness
  - I am lazy.  I go to great lengths to avoid spending X hours doing manual repetitive work that a computer should be able to do for me and instead am much happier spending Y hours learning how to get a computer to do it for me.  My goal is that Y < 3X.

* Plotting
 - Basic plotting
http://python4astronomers.github.io/plotting/matplotlib.html
 - Plotting for Paper figures 
http://python4astronomers.github.io/plotting/publication.html#publication-quality-plots

# For Python there's also the matplotlib example gallery
http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html
# For a nice collection of examples in IDL and Python, see 
http://astroplotlib.stsci.edu/

* Histograms
 - How do we choose the binning for histograms in general?
 - For some useful disussion, see
http://www.astroml.org/user_guide/density_estimation.html#bayesian-blocks-histograms-the-right-way

* Fitting
 - Curve Fitting in SciPy (as a Python notebook)
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/media.usm.maine.edu/~pauln/ScipyScriptRepo/CurveFitting.ipynb
 - Least Squares fitting in SciPy
 http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/FittingData
 - For a very relevant example of fitting d_L, see
http://www.astroml.org/book_figures/chapter8/fig_nonlinear_mu_z.html
  -- If you don't have astroML, then you can adapt the astropy.Cosmology module
